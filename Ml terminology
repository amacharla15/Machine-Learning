ML terminology:

Features - X - GDP per capita
Labels - y - Life satisfaction
y hat - predicted values 
Loss function → “How bad was my prediction for this one example?”
Cost function → “On average, how bad am I doing across all examples?”
=====================================================================

Closed form without Gradient Descent:::

life_satisfaction = θ0 + θ1 × GDP_per_capita

Training → Find θ₀, θ₁ from data (by minimizing error)

θ₀ (intercept) → baseline prediction when x = 0

θ₁ (slope) → how much prediction changes per unit change in x

Prediction → plug new x into equation

Step 3: Formula to find θ₁ and θ₀ (closed form)

For simple linear regression:
θ1​=∑(xi​−xˉ)(yi​−yˉ​)​ /∑(xi​)^2

θ0​=yˉ​−θ1​⋅xˉ  , 

xˉ - mean of x values
yˉ - mean of y values
