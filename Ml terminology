ML terminology:

Features - X - GDP per capita
Labels - y - Life satisfaction
y hat - predicted values 
Loss function → “How bad was my prediction for this one example?”
Cost function → “On average, how bad am I doing across all examples?”
=====================================================================
Step 1: Simple Linear Regression - Works only when you have 1 feature (x) - one column.

life_satisfaction = θ0 + θ1 × GDP_per_capita

Training → Find θ₀, θ₁ from data (by minimizing error)

θ₀ (intercept) → baseline prediction when x = 0

θ₁ (slope) → how much prediction changes per unit change in x

Prediction → plug new x into equation

Step 3: Formula to find θ₁ and θ₀ (closed form)

For simple linear regression:
θ1​=∑(xi​−xˉ)(yi​−yˉ​)​ /∑(xi​)^2

θ0​=yˉ​−θ1​⋅xˉ  , 

xˉ - mean of x values
yˉ - mean of y values

It comes from solving the MSE minimization by hand for one variable. Very fast and simple — no matrices needed.

Example: If you have just GDP → Life Satisfaction, use this formula.
==========================================================================================
2. The matrix form (Normal Equation) — Multiple Linear Regression
θ=(XTX)−1XTy

Works for any number of features (1, 2, 10, 100…).

Handles multiple features automatically.

Uses linear algebra instead of separate slope/intercept formulas.

The bias term is handled by adding that first column of 1s in X.

Example:

If you have GDP & Education → Life Satisfaction,
or more features like healthcare, pollution, crime rate,
the simple formula won’t work — you need this matrix form.

example: 2. Put our data into a matrix

Let’s take this dataset:

GDP (x₁)	Education (x₂)	Life Satisfaction (y)
20	7	10
15	5	8
25	8	11

We build X:

First column = 1 for bias term (x₀)

Second column = GDP values

Third column = Education values

X = [[1, 20, 7],
     [1, 15, 5],
     [1, 25, 8]]
y = [[10],
     [8],
     [11]]
The formula
does not give you only θ₀ or only θ₁ — it gives you all the parameters at once.

the first value in the matrix is theta 0 `(the intercept)
the second value is theta 1 (the coefficient for GDP)
the third value is theta 2 (the coefficient for Education)

θ₀ = bias (intercept) — first element of the vector.

θ₁…θₙ = weights for each feature — the rest of the elements.
