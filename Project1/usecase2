2) The goal for this exercise is to understand gradient descent and the fit/cost
function method to define a function to find a global best fit or minimum cost. Please read
and complete the following Jupyter notebook (04_training_linear_models.ipynb) and refer to
Chapter 4 reading for more background. Once you have completed the reading and notebook
examples, please provide a screenshot of 3 models side-by-side for the generated data
including the best linear regression and a polynomial fit for degree=2 and degree=3. Reading
the Wikipedia page on Polynomial regression may help you to better understand the methods
used for polynomial models (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression). After
you have shown your 3 comparative models as plots and commented on which is best and
why, then answer the following questions:

a) Based on your side-by-side comparison, which modeling method (linear, or polynomial
degree=2 or 3) is best and why?

b)
 What is the best overall gradient descent method and why?

 c) For your three models (linear, degree=2, and degree=3), what is the MSE (Mean Square
Error) and RMSE (Root MSE) for each?

d) What are the key hyper-parameters you used for your linear, degree=2, and degree=3
models?
