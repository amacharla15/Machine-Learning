1)The goal for this exercise is to experiment with a Python Scikit learn linear
regression model as an abstraction that is used to model data collected based on
measurements (financial or surveys for example) and then predict the value of missing data
using the model created. Please read and complete the following Jupyter notebook
(01_the_machine_learning_landscape.ipynb) and refer to Chapter 1, 2, and 4 reading for
more background. Once you have completed the reading and notebook, provide a screenshot
of what you believe is the best linear regression for the GDP example for the corresponding
ϴ0 and ϴ1, and then please answer the following questions:

a) Show your best regression results and describe the parameters (ϴ0 and ϴ1) used in the
GDP linear regression model (e.g., how do they compare to the equation of a line)?

b) What is the cost function that is used by SciKit to determine if the model is improving as
the two parameters are updated during training? (If you cannot figure this out from the
code, then based on looking ahead at the chapter 4 reading, what would be ideal?)

c) What is the difference in use of data for training, validation, and testing while developing
ML models?

d) Describe Python code used that you did not fully understand (e.g., model.fit(X, y)) and
attempt to explain it better by looking up the function in SciKit learn documentation
(https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and describe it to the point where you believe you could
implement the function instead of just calling it.
